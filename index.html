                <h3>Arm action, and other notes</h3>
                <p>Arm action is one of the more controversial topics with regards to golf instruction, largely because different teachers approach it in directly contrasting ways. While the popular wisdom is to have the swing dominated by your trunk and lower body, others suggest that having good 'arm feel' is the key to becoming an above average golfer. In the downswing, the common advice is to flatten the shaft to start and add wrist flexion; but tell that to instructors like Malaska and Scheinblum and you would be laughed at. They suggest that the arms redirect the momentum of the club back in front of you as soon as possible, which at some point involves steepening during the downswing.</p>
                <img src = "images/arms.jpg">
                <p>Many of the issues can be attributed to improper use of video and camera angles. Using a 2-D representation to describe a three-dimensional motion will always present issues; it does not accurately depict how different parts of the body are oriented or moving with respect to one another. In analyzing a pro's swing, then, you should be taking commentary with a grain of salt because you may not draw the same conclusions.</p>
                <p>More on this later, here are some other notes I've taken in the past week on my own swing.</p>
                <ul class = "notes">
                    <li>Allow for horizontal vertical space for LAFW.</li>
                    <li>Right arm pushes on the aft side of the club PARALLEL to the swing arc, not OVER and left!</li>
                    <li>Alignment should be adjusted for proper swing arc, i.e. parallel and left of target.</li>
                    <li>Do not add ulnar deviation (downward cocking), the amount of deviation at set up is approximate to the amount at impact.</li>
                    <li>The feel for a neutral grip is that the heel pad is more ON TOP of the grip, with the palm facing the target.</li>
                    <li>Counterbalance: as you swing out at the ball, your body is pushing away from the ball (i.e. consider how one generates speed in a baseball swing).</li>
                    <li>Consider flaring out your left foot, as this seems to be your natural tendency for proper alignment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Analyzing impact conditions</h3>
                <p>Impact is referred to as the moment of truth in the golf swing, because it is the impact conditions alone that will determine where the ball goes. Executing the perfect takeaway, backswing, and follow-through is meaningless if the ball goes sideways. The 18 inches of the swing before and after its intersection with the ball are all that matter. This is why professional golfers can have drastically different looking swings but hit the ball with the center of the clubface every time - their impact conditions are nearly identical.</p>
                <img src = "images/impact.jpg">
                <p>The question at hand, however, is how to interpret your own impact conditions and use that information to benefit your game. Collecting the data is simple enough - spray some hair product on the clubface or purchase a pack of impact stickers. The ball will leave a mark wherever it strikes the clubface. So you can find out whether a shot you thought was poor was hit out of the toe or heel, the bottom or top of the clubface. If you have access to Trackman, it can provide even more accurate data on your clubface and path at impact. This is just another means of getting feedback on your swing.</p>
                
                <p>Okay, so you learn that you've been hitting the ball off of the toe consistently. Does that mean you should scooting close to the ball? Does that you mean you're changing the lie of the club i.e. more upright relative to its original position? Does that mean your perception of the 'middle' of the club during setup is off?</p>
                
                <p>More to be discussed in a later post.</p>

                <h3>The importance of pre-swing fundamentals</h3>
                <p>This it the first post of this blog, so I ought to make it as flamboyant and controversial as possible. I could talk about the inherent folly of position-based teaching that has captured the minds of students and instructors alike, focusing on form over function. Or about how the elitist connotations that come with playing golf will doom the sport to mediocrity with respect to viewership and popularity. Or how the absurd costs of playing golf leaves minorities at a disdvantage and exploits the weekend golfer. I could go into these discussions.</p>
                
                <p>Instead, I will talk about the more technical aspects of golf, because they are the things that most captivate my attention. I love to get lost in the details of the swing: the kinesthetic chain, the arm-swing illusion, the clubface vs. clubpath debate on what produces curvature in shots. But before any of that, I should go into everything that happens before you even address the ball.</p>
                
                <p>This could be collectively referred to as the 'pre-shot routine', a series of actions that one regularly takes before each and every shot. Each action has a distinct purpose with regards to preparing for the shot and maximizing the probability of success.</p>
                
                <p>Alignment is the first and foremost thing to consider in your pre-shot routine. Amateurs are often fixated on the ball alone that they forget the literal intent of the swing: to send the ball towards a particular target. Training yourself to have this intent is essential because it will affect how you perceive your own motions during the swing in innummerable ways. Are you lifting the club to create space for your arms to rotate through the hitting area, or is it to chop down on the ball with maximum force?</p>
                
                <img src = "images/target.jpg">
                
                <p>Of course to align yourself properly, you first need to choose a target - a specific point whether it's a tree, the corner of a bunker, whatever. This eluded me for the majorify of my golfing life because I did not take it seriously. I was satisfied with aiming in the same general direction as the target, not knowing if I was actually lined up 5 yards offline or 50 yards.</p>
                
                <p>So choose a target. And if the target is too far away, choose an intermediate point that is between your ball and the target - a divot, leaf, etc. This sounds so basic but I doubt amateurs, myself included, take the requisite time before each shot to align themselves and train their minds this way.</p>
                
                <p>This is just one of many actions you can take to maximize the chances you execute a successful shot before you even touch the club. Looking for obstacles and safe landing areas, accounting for the ball's lie are other habits to integrate into your routine. You will become a more consistent player because of it.</p>
